<h1>Not a collaborator yet!</h1>

<p>This is a rather awkward limitation of Github. You need to be a &quot;Collaborator&quot; on a
    repository before you can save changes. Becoming a collaborator is VERY easy. You have to email
    me (archisgore [at] yahoo [dot] com) with your github login: </p>
<div id="loginholder"></div>

<p>Once this is done, you can attempt to <a href="/edit">open the editor again</a>.</p>

<p>You can always <a href="/">go back to the maps page</a> to continue searching for and viewing dive sites.</p>
